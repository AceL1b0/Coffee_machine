# What is this project about?

This is a simple coffee machine code, using Object Oriented Programming. 
This is one of my first project using OOP. I didn't want to copy coffee 
machine code from other users on the web or from GitHub as well so 
I learned it by doing step by step.

The main goal was that it looks more complex, using maximum of OOP
structure and principles, not just linear coding. The point was, that
code isn't too much complex and advanced according to my current 
knowledge of Python.
